# Challenge #10 - Beginner
# Calculate the area of a circle
# Objective: Practice math operations, user input validation, and functions

"""
Program to calculate the area of a circle.
Prompts user for radius, validates input, and returns the area.
Helps practice math module usage, input handling, and function design.
