# Challenge #16 - Intermediate
# Find and display classmates with shared classes
# Objective: Practice nested loops, set operations, and formatted terminal output

"""
Generate a clean, colorized report showing which students share classes.
Uses set intersections to find shared courses and ANSI codes for colorful output.
Demonstrates nested loop logic and string formatting for readability.
