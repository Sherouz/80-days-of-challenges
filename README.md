# 80 Days of Challenges 🐍

A personal Python challenge to improve my problem-solving and programming skills.
Over 80 days, I complete small Python exercise (5–50 lines) to practice logic, algorithms, and Python basics.

---

## 📌 Goal

- Strengthen understanding of programming logic
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Build a collection of small, readable Python scripts
- Share progress on Twitter: `#80DaysOfChallenges`
