# 80 Days of Challenges 🐍

A personal Python challenge to improve my problem-solving and programming skills.
Over 80 days, I complete small Python exercise (5–50 lines) to practice logic, algorithms, and Python basics.

---

## 📌 Goal

- Strengthen understanding of programming logic
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Build a collection of small, readable Python scripts
- Share progress on Twitter: `#80DaysOfChallenges`

## 💡 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sherouz/80-days-of-challenges.git
```

2. Open any script with Python 3:

```bash
python scripts/string_reverse.py
```

3. Modify or try different approaches for practice.
4. **Elevator game example:**

```bash
python scripts/elevator_game.py
```

* Follow the prompts or check the function `calculate_floor` for logic practice.
* Beginners: try easier floors first. Intermediate: challenge yourself with harder logic.
